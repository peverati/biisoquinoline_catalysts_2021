This GitHub repository collects all the data for the article just accepted in *Catalysis*. It includes:

* a **Geometries** folder, with the geometries for all the species studied;

* an **Excel file** titled "supporting_material_Catalysis_1.xlsx," which includes the electronic and Gibbs free energies of all species, as well as the results of the DFT study;

* a **pdf file** titled "supporting_material_Catalysis_2.pdf," which shows details for the DFT study, pictures of all the transition structures optimized in this work, and additional references.
